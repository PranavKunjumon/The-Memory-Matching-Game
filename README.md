# The-Memory-Matching-Game
The Memory Matching Game is a fun Unity 3D game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. Each match earns 10 points, and the game tracks attempts. Reaching 80 points triggers a victory message and a restart option. With smooth animations and a clean UI, itâ€™s a great way to test memory skills!
